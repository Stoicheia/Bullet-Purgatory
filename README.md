# Bullet-Purgatory
Bullet hell game where things shoot to the music. Music is your ammunition. Run out of music and you lose the level.

Key Features:

 - Each song has multiple "song lines". Each weapon's "beat" follows the rhythm defined by one of these song lines.
 - Each song line is divided into "styles". Weapons may change how/what/if they shoot depending on which style is active.
 - Dialogue system. Game is silent/plays ambient sound during dialogue sequence. Music starts after a character says "the music is starting..." or something.
 - Shoot sounds to show off how well the weapons are synced to the music.

Planned Cool Features:

 - Upgrade that temporarily changes the music to a more soothing tune, making enemies more docile.
      - Obviously, this means that slower/more simple music corresponds to better upgrade.
      - (Maybe) the ability to compose your own soothing tunes w/ automatically generated song lines.
 - Add a more intense baseline, increasing the power of both you and the enemy.
 - Short opening tunes/ending tunes for each character. Longer or slower openings/endings correspond to better characters.
 - Actual art (made in inkscape).
 
 Game (specifically the wave system) somewhat inspired by Bullet Heaven by kupogames.
