# Bullet-Purgatory
Bullet hell game where everything shoots to the music. Music is your ammunition. Run out of music and you lose the level.

Key Features:

 - Weapons shoot to either the melody, the groove, or a constant rhythm. They combine to form a symphony of bullets!
 - Collect money and buy upgrades!
 - Enemies come in waves. After the boss there are bonus waves. You beat the level if you kill the boss, but beat the bonus waves to get a higher ranking!
 - 4 worlds of 24? levels, each with unique enemies and bosses!
 - There's this powerup that allows you to change the song mid-level. This makes bullets shoot differently. Use this to extend the level or to temporarily decrease the difficulty.
 - Original score by yours truly
 
Inspirations - Bullet Heaven 2 (kupogames), Cadence of Hyrule (nintendo)
